# live-build fork (Finnix)

You probably want [finnix-live-build](https://github.com/finnix/finnix-live-build), the repository used to build Finnix images.

The [main](https://github.com/finnix/live-build/tree/main) branch of this repository contains a fork of the upstream Debian [live-build](https://salsa.debian.org/live-team/live-build) repository, and is pulled in as a submodule by [finnix-live-build](https://github.com/finnix/finnix-live-build).

It strives to be the same codebase as upstream, and usually is, but occasionally contains commits needed for Finnix which have not yet been accepted upstream.
